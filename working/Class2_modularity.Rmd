# Programming Always Starts with 

<span style="color: cyan;"> Conceptual Design </span>

* What is the goal
* What are the inputs
* What are the outputs


# Modularity

* Programs are made up of building blocks
* A **main program** that controls the flow and **calls** functions/modules/building blocks

# Modules take you from inputs to outputs in pieces

- helpful to start a software engineering project by **diagramming** or
**flow charting ** your program 

* what is the goal
* inputs and output
* what are key building blocks - modules or functions
* how do you put the blocks together to go from input to output - main program

# Flow Chart Example

[Flow chart Example] (https://images.app.goo.gl/ktxjSGC2Dyi1WQFA6)


# Designing Modularity

Breaking your instructions down into individual pieces
identifying instructions that can be reused
 
EXAMPLES

* an ecosystem model might re-use instructions for calculating how a species grows
* an accounting program might re-use instructions for computing net present value from interest rates

# Designing Modularity

Modules often become ‘black boxes’ which hides detail that might make understanding the program overly complex

Most languages have lots of black boxes already written and most allow you to write your own



# STEPS IN Program Design for Each Module and Overal Program Design

1. Clearly define your goal in words/figures as precisely as possible, what do you want your program to do
      + inputs/parameters
      +  outputs
      + modulees
      * flow between modules
      

2. Implement AND document as you go
3. Test
4. Refine
5. Test again
6. Create User Documentation and Distribute

# Some Examples

**Inputs** - sometimes separated into input data and parameters

* input data = the “what” that is manipulated
* parameters determine “how” the manipulation is done

Here's an example of a R black box function -**sort**

* inputs - data stream

* parameters - how to do the sort

# Some Examples

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE  }

# look at a R data set on Biological Oxygen Demand over time

# notice the use of data - R function that brings pre-stored datasets into the work space
data(BOD)

# notice "help" and the information that it provides
help(BOD)

# options for looking at data
view(BOD)

head(BOD)

# example of a function - SORT
result = sort(BOD[,"demand"], decreasing=TRUE, method="quick")
head(result)
```


In this example, parameters are **decreasing** and **method**

output is a sorted version of saved to “result”

# Another Example

An phone app for calculating car mileage

* inputs are location, price,  gallons and odometer readings at each fill up
* graph of is miles/gallon over time
* parameters control units (could be km/liter, output couple be presented as a graph or an average value)

[Gas Mileage App](https://www.igeeksblog.com/jerrycan-iphone-app/)

*examples a)  simple (single box); b)  more complex (3 boxes)*

# Designing Modularity

Breaking your instructions down into individual pieces
identifying instructions that can be reused

basic modules are called **functions** in R 

# Learn to think in terms of function

* break your tasks into boxes with inputs, parameters and output
* **WRITE DOWN** the *contract* for each box/function

**CONTRACT**

* if the users gives you A, the function with return B
* specify A and B as precisely as you can (units, time/space scale, parameters, options)

# A simple function example - just one module

Contract

*Input*: Reservoir height (m) and flow rate (m3/sec) (as a single value in time or a time series)

*Output*: Instantaneous power generation (W/s)  (as a single value or value for each reservoir height and flow rate combination)

*Parameters*: KEfficiency, ρ (density of water), g (acceleration due to gravity)

What the function will do - compute power using the following equation - *body* of the function 

P = ρ * h * r * g * KEff;

P is Power in watts, ρ is the density of water (~1000 kg/m3), h is height in meters, r is flow rate in cubic meters per second, g is acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 m/s2, KEff is a coefficient of efficiency ranging from 0 to 1.

# A more complex one

* Goal  - Calculate profit from a reservoir feed by a stream gages, if a minumum reservoir volume must be maintained and otherwide reservoir is operated at a set flow rate, that is set by the user

*Input*  Stream gage data (m3/sec)

*Parameters* Efficiency, ρ (density of water), g (acceleration due to gravity), Maximum Reservoir Capacity $(m^3)$, Minimum Reservoir Volume $(m^3)$, Set flow rate $(m^3/sec)$, Price of power $($/W)$

*Output* Profit ($)

*Modules*

* Compute Power from a given reservoir height and flow rate (compute_power)
* Keep track of reservoir volume given inflow and output (reservoir_state)
* Determine flow rate, given operator desiered flow rate but need for minium capacity (determine_flow_rate)
* Compute profit from power (compute_profit)

Each module would have its own inputs, parameters and output

Flow control diagrm - puts the modules together

# Making Diagrams

There are many options for making flow charts or diagrams to support your programmming

I like  this free one accessible online from chrome

[Diagram.net](https://www.diagrams.net/)

[Example](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UaDyKDgf0RQCjicMWUXA7gr4l1QK-X1y/view?usp=sharing)

# Your Task

With your group, think of an example program that you might want to design that is complex enough to involve several modules

* write a contract for the overall program (input, output, parameters)
* break the program in to modules (naming them appropriately), wrate a contract for each one
* create a diagram that shows how these modules would be put together to go from inputs to output for the overall program (you can use diagram.net OR any other software - your choice!)

## Important

Next class we will go through how to make a function in R
Go through *starting_functions.Rmd* BEFORE next class - play with it; come ready to ask questions in class
