# Some conventions (helpful later in the course)

* Always write your function in a text editor and then copy into R

* By convention we name files with functions in them by the name of the function.R
I called my function power_gen_orig so I'll save it to

e.g. **power_gen_orig.R**

* you can have R read a text file by source(“power_gen_orig.R”) - make sure you are in the right working directory

* keep organized by keeping all functions in a subdirectory called *R*

*  Eventually we will want our function to be part of a package (a library of many functions) - to create a package you must use this convention (name.R) place all function in a directory called “R”


# Function Example

```{r  examples, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}

# first set your working directory to just above the R directory
source("R/power_gen_orig.R")

# to see the code
power_gen_orig

```

# Some insights into inputs

A cool thing is that you can use multiple values as inputs to your R function
Lets explore what it can do

```{r usingfunctions, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
# note that this works (calculates power for each height)
power_gen_orig(height=c(1,4,5), flow=2)

# and this works (calculates power for each flow rate)
power_gen_orig(height=4, flow=c(2,4,5))

# and this calculates power for each combination of flow and height
power_gen_orig(height=c(4,5,6), flow=c(2,4,6))

# but this doesn't work - why?
power_gen_orig(height=c(4,5,6, 8, 20), flow=c(2,4,6))

```

#
Note that by *sourcing* a function - it will essentially overwrite anything else in your workspace with the same name 

*Warning* - if you name your function, the same as an internal R function, your new function will take precidence, and **hide** the internal R function

Ideally choose function names that are likely to be unique 

If you overwrite a *base* package R function - good to delete it (see below)

You can also use *package_name*:: to get to a function that is hidden in the current workspace

#
```{r hidden, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, error=TRUE}


# hiding the sort function

# normal use
mydata = c(1,5,8,22,2)
sort(mydata)

# define a new function that adds two numbers - silly - but lets call it sort
sort = function(a,b) {
  add = a+b
  return(add)
}

# now run
sort(mydata)

# how do we get the base package sort back
base::sort(mydata)

# or get rid of our silly function in the workspace
rm(sort)
sort(mydata)
```


# Lets practice:: Automobile Power Generation



Some background

One of the equations used to compute automobile fuel efficiency is as follows this is the power required to keep a car moving at a given speed is as follows:


$Pb = crolling * m *g *V + \frac{1}{2} * A*p_{air}*c_{drag}*V^3$


where crolling and cdrag are rolling and aerodynamic resistive coefficients, typical values are 0.015 and 0.3, respectively.

- V: is vehicle speed (assuming no headwind) in m/s (or mps) m: is vehicle mass in kg

- A is surface area of car $(m^2)$

- *g*: is acceleration due to gravity $(9.8 m/s^2 )$ 

- p_air = density of air $(1.2kg/m^3 )$

- Pb is power in Watts

What would be the function's contract - input/parameters? what will it do?

Write a function to compute power, given a truck of m=31752 kg (parameters for a heavy truck) for a range of different highway speeds (30 m/s, 80 km/hr, 120 km/hr, 40 km/hr )
Plot power as a function of speed
Add a second line for lighter vehicle
Remember to keep the function in its own file and then create a Rmarkdown to use the function

Good Programming Practices:

Name variables so its easy to understand
Include comments in the function and at the top to make it easy to understand
Also include the comments in the Rmarkdown that you are using to run the function
