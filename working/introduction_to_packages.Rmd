# <span style="color:orange">PACKAGES in R</span>

## <span style="color:orange">Definitions</span>

* **Package**: An extension of the R base system with functions, data and documentation in standardized
format.
* **Library**: A directory containing installed packages.
* **Repository**: A website providing packages for installation.
* **Source**: The original version of a package with human-readable text and code.
* **Binary**: A compiled version of a package with computer-readable text and code, may work only
on a specic platform.
* **Base packages**: Part of the R source tree, maintained by R Core.
* **Recommended packages**: Part of every R installation, but not necessarily maintained by R
Core.
* **Contributed packages**: All the rest. This does not mean that these packages are necessarily of
lesser quality than the above, e.g., many contributed packages on CRAN are written and
maintained by R Core members. They simply try to keep the base distribution as lean as
possible.
* **User packages**: Packages that you write, share with a smaller community - not downloadable
from CRAN, but can be downloaded (or sent as a zip file) and loaded into R

# <span style="color:orange">Why make packages</span>

* to easily share functions and data with others with R-specific documentation

* have a set of tools (functions) that you often use, that can be easily loaded

* be part of the R community


#  <span style="color:orange">Installing User Packages</span>
* looks similar to CRAN packages

* uncompiled (they can be compiled but not always) so  you can **see** the code

You can load my package *rainbow* by 

  * downloading *rainbow.tar.gz *
    * DON'T UNZIP
  
  * install from a *package archive*
  
  
 Alternatively you can install from *github* - you need the *devtools* library to do this
 
 install_github("naomitague/rainbow")


Use of spring.summary
```{r packageapp, eval=FALSE}


# load "stuff" in your package including R
library(rainbow)


# notice
help(compute_NPV)
help(spring_summary)

```
# <span style="color:orange">Steps for starting a package</span>

* Think of a name for your package, it should be descriptive of the many related functions that you will store there
      * mine will be **rainbow**

* Create repository for this package on **git**

* Back in Rstudio, 
  * start a new project, using the same name for the project as your package name
    * choose the option in package creation to **create a package**
    * make sure that the **path** to this directory is not in the course directory, or other directory that is 
already under version control (git)
    * link to your existing Github repository
    
* If you already have an R function you can add it here
  * make sure your function is named **something.R** and follows the format for functions that we have been using 
  * try adding one of the functions that you created to compute diversity
  
* Install libraries **devtools** and **roxygen2** from CRAN

* Link with a git repository post creation: see project set up on R **Tools** menu

# <span style="color:orange">Making your own packages</span>

You will notice that this creates a directory structure that looks something like this

R Package Directory ![](Rdirstruct.jpeg)

Your R function will be stored in the **R** subdirectory
IF **man** and **data**, **tests** subdirectories are not created - created them

This package (e.g **rainbow**)  directory structures  store your code and documentation; that is easy for R to read. It include

* A file DESCRIPTION with descriptions of the package, author, and license conditions
* A man/ subdirectory of documentation files.
* An R/ subdirectory of R code.
* A data/ subdirectory of datasets.
