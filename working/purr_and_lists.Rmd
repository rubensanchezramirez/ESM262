When you have lists with multiple elements it can be challenging to extract things

*purrr* library has some useful options
```{r}
# make a list
sale = list(id=1, quality="high", contents=c("apple","cherry"), cost=c(4,5))
sale

sale2 = list(id=2, quality="low", contents=c("apple"), cost=c(4,5))

sale3 = list(id=3, quality="high", contents=c("cherry","apple","mango"), cost=c(4,5,9))
  
# combine lists into a market           
market = list(sale,sale2,sale3)

market[[1]]
market[[1]]$contents

# now do we get all the contents
# this is where purr family "map" comes in - it finds 

map(market, "contents")

# we could same this and unlist it to analyze the data
# unlist is another helpful functions
contents = map(market, "contents")

contents

contents = unlist(contents)
contents

summary(as.factor(contents))


```
